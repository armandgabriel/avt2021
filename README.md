Assignments:

--> Implement a Base64 encoder and decoder. The solution should receive from command line the
name of the input plaintext file and the name of the output encoded text  

--> Implement the Vigenere cipher in assembly. The solution should receive from command line the
password, the name of the input plaintext file and the name of the output cipher text

-->  Implement the Playfair cipher in assembly. The solution should receive from command line the
password, the name of the input plaintext file and the name of the output cipher text

--> Timid II - Exercise 4, page 86 in Giant Black Book of Computer Viruses (on Sakai in Resources
folder). There is no reason a virus must put itself all at the beginning or at the end .........
